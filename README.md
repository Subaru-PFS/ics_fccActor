NanEye is a tiny camera module which consists of a CMOS image sensor. This sensor can be assembled with a special lens, fits in a diameter of only 1.5mm, works fully autonomous and can drive up to 2m cable without any external components at the distal end.
The camera optic covers a field of 1mm x 1mm with 62.5 KPixel (250 x 250 Pixel) at a 3um pitch and provides clear and sharp images.
